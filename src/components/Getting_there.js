                  Our nearest stations are East Grinstead and Cowden.
                  The train runs directly from London Victoria or London Bridge to East Grinstead in about 1 hour.
                  From East Grinstead, you can take the 291 bus to Upper Hartfield, where it stops at the entrance of the farm (you will then need to walk about 15 minutes to reach the site â€“ all downhill!). Alternatively, you could take a taxi which would be a 15 minute drive from the station.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Check the 291 bus timetable here. The route would be from East Grinstead Station to Upper Hartfield, Garage.
                  Cowden station is an 11 minute drive away, however it is quite remote and there are no buses or other transport links from here to the farm.
                </p>
